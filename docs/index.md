## Unity Hub (and then Unity)

**Install Unity Hub:**
1. Download the [Unity Hub][] installer and install **Unity Hub.**
1. Create a Unity account (use the **Sign in with Goggle** button and sign in with your school Google account if you would prefer not to create an account with Unity directly).
1. Add a license - since you don't use Unity in a professional capacity (yet) you qualify for a personal license.

**Add a Unity Install:**
1. In our lab we try to run the latest version of the **2018.4 LTS release**, currently that is 2018.4.10f1. The installed version is not updated between prototypes, so it may be behind what is available in our lab. Older versions can be downloaded from the Unity web site.

**For macOS:**
1. Uncheck the **Visual Studio for Mac** option - we will use Visual Studio Code on all platforms.

**For Windows:**
