## Unity Hub (and then Unity)

**Install Unity Hub:**
1. Download the [Unity Hub][] installer and install **Unity Hub.**
1. Create a Unity account (use the **Sign in with Goggle** button and sign in with your school Google account if you would prefer not to create an account with Unity directly).
1. Add a license - since you don't use Unity in a professional capacity (yet) you qualify for a personal license.
